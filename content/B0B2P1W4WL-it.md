ℹ️:

- PolyLite is a family of 3D printing filaments made with the best raw materials to deliver exceptional quality and reliability. PolyLite covers the most popular 3D printing materials to meet your everyday needs in design and prototyping.
- Polymaker Jam-Free Technology increases the heat resistance of the filament itself (not the printed part) to 140˚C. This prevent any jamming issue due to the hot end heat creep issue. Heat creep is the process of heat spreading irregularly throughout your hot end, softening the filament before entering the melting chamber and jamming the filament by making it expand in the cold end. The increase of the filament heat resistance from 60˚C to 140˚C ensures a Jam-Free experience.
- PolyLite PLA is a high-quality PLA designed for reliability and ease of printing. PolyLite PLA is based on a high molecular weight PLA from Natureworks, which makes it one of the most rigid PLA material on the market.
