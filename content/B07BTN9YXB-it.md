At the heart of the game is an immersive story with twists and turns that pull you in and keep you craving more from the opening cutscene to the final credits!
- Explore a Beautiful, Living World - DRAGON QUEST XI brings a massive, gorgeous world to life in a style that blends stylistic cel-shading with photorealistic detail. Excitement lurks around every corner as players explore populous cities, quaint villages, magnificent castles, and dark dungeons. NPCs attend to their daily schedules, monsters change behaviors to fit their environments, and players can access new areas with the use of monstrous vehicles.
